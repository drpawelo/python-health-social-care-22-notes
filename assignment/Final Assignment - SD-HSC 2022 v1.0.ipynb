    "# Final Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Final assignment for Introduction to software development in health and social care (2021-2022) works the same way as your draft assignment. You are asked to write **TWO SEPARATE MINI-REPORTS**, each accompanied by code and a visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Learn you will accurate and up to date details about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- submission deadlines\n",
    "- marking criteria\n",
    "- where and in what format to submit\n",
    "- more info about the three components of each minireport (code, visualisation, written mini-report)\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think abotu the reports is: Imagine you are an NHS junior data analyst and you are responding by email to a journalist. Try to explain things they might not know. Focus on what they might find interesting in your writeup. Make your visualisation understandable and well signposted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important bits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- remember you need to submit two independent mini-reports (each consisting of: code, visualisation & written report)\n",
    "- do not share your code for this assignment on Learn - this is an individual university assignment, and normal rules of 'own work' and plagiarisn apply.\n",
    "- signpost your work with headers (ex. \"report 1 code\", \"report 1 visualisation\", \"report 2 code\" etc)\n",
    "- do your work in this notebook, details of submission will be in learn\n",
    "- written part of mini-reports will be short, about 2 paragraphs of text (200 words +/- 10%) explaining what you saw in the data, what question you identified, and how you answered it with code."
